Something very strange
happened last month. A
naughty, young giant moved
all the world’s famous
landmarks.
People around the world were
very confused.
He put the Pyramids in Paris.
‘And on your
left the … Pyramids?’
He moved the Leaning Tower of
Pisa to London.
‘Here we can
see the famous … leaning
tower of … London?’
