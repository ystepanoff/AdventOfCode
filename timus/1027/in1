Hello, here is a sample D++ program. It contains some arithmetical expressions like
(2+2=4), (2+-/*) and ((3+3)*3=20(*this is not true, but you donâ€™t have to verify it :-) *)+8)
 (* the closing bracket in the previous comment is also in order, since this bracket
does not belong to any arithmetical expression*)
